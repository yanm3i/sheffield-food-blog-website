        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
          <p> As the creator of the website, I am committed to making 'Eat with UoS' accessible as possible, in accordance to the assignment brief. </p>
          <!-- reference to the accessibility statement I derived from -->

          <p>
            To make my website accessible to everyone, I ensured to keep my website quite simplistic as to not overwhelm users with a complex layout. For every image I used, I ensured to put in an alternative text for anyone using a screen reader. Screen readers can be easily downloaded online or added as an extension, that helps navigate the page without vision or a mouse:
          </p>
          <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn">Screen reader chrome extension</a>
        
        
          <p>
            For the animations that I used, such as for the answers on the quiz page, I enabled the animations to ease into it with a long spin time so that it wouldn't be too sudden for anyone, while being fun at the same time. As it's animation that requires you to hover to reveal, it may cause some issues in the user's knowledge of where to position the mouse, which wouldn't make it fully accessible. 
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Considering the general colour scheme, I tried to keep to a brown-yellow theme, ensuring to contrast the colours between the background and text so that people wouldn't struggle as hard to read them. I tested each page with the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE: https://wave.webaim.org/), to ensure that I didn't have any outstanding issues that I needed to alter. It helped me find out any colour combinations that didn't have enough contrast.
