        <h3>Legal issues</h3>
        <p>
          When it comes to public websites, they would have to consider the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1], which would protect the page visitor's personal data rights.
          <br>
          Within the limited scope of this project, the only data that would theoretically be taken in would be the user's name and email address, but as it isn't required to function, there is no database that stores that information. Therefore, the website would comply with GDPR as the website does not record personal information aside from the site owner, myself. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to avoid any violation of someone's copyright, I took images, where I could, from the University website or the Sheffield government website. Usually, I would have to ask for permission before using these, but I made sure to source the images underneath each of them.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="security">
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>Similar to the legal issues when it comes to GDPR, the website doesn't have many security measures as the user's information isn't actually being sent or stored anywhere, so currently there wouldn't be a need to ensure for a secure website. 
        <br><br>
        If the information from the contact form was being stored, then it should not be publicly available to the point that they can be identified through the information given (without permission) [2].
