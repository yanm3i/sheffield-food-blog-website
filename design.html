      <section id="intro">
        <p>The general idea of my website was to have a friendly and welcoming site that gave off a classical cafe vibe. Thus, I went for a brown and yellow colour scheme that could remind the user of hot drinks such as coffee or tea. At the same time, it should have a light hearted tone as I'm touring the customer around my site.</p>

      <section id="sitemap"> 
        <h3>Sitemap</h3>
        <img src="sitemap1.JPG" alt="Site Map of website from header">
        <img src="sitemap2.JPG" alt="Site Map of website from footer">
        <h4>Justification of Structure</h4>
        <p>
          Sticking to the assignment brief, I created this site map for the header hyperlinks and also the footer links to each individual html page. By keeping the subtitles simple but related, I can keep the design consistent while including everything that is required from the assignment. 
        </p>
        <h4>Breakpoints & Tweakpoints </h4>
        <p>
          I decided to use two breakpoints and one tweakpoint for my website: a mobile structure, a desktop structure and a tablet structure. I decided to make the tablet a tweakpoint of the mobile design as I felt that the font & image structuring needed a size inbetween the mobile and desktop. 
          <br><br>
          The difference between the two breakpoints would mostly be the resizing of items such as images and paragraphs (shown in the design mockups below) and also the navigation menu. Since the horizontal listing of the navigation buttons were too long on tablet and mobile, it was made a vertical list for easier viewing. 
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="designmockup">
        <h3>Design Mock-ups</h3>
        <p>Keeping in the mobile-first approach, I created design mock-ups for a mobile and desktop page. For the tablet, it would follow the design of the mobile but with larger fonts. I created two designs because I wanted the general formatting to be the same across all pages; keeping to a consistent theme.</p>
        <div class="container">
          <div id="imagelocation">
            <img id="pictures" src="mobiledesigntwo.jpg" alt="Mobile">
          </div>
          <div class="description2">
            <p >In the mobile design, I decided to place the images and paragraphs to be in a column so that the visibility of them is clear to the user in mobile view. 
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <div id="imagelocation">
            <img  src="desktopdesign.jpg" alt="Mobile">
          </div>
          <div class="description2">
            <p >In the desktop view, I decided that when it is at full page, the image would shrink to half of the page and the text would move from under it to beside it on the left. This is so the picture is visible to the user on one page. </p>
          </div>

      </section>
        
      <section id="menusystem">
        <h4>Menu System</h4>
        <p>
          In contrast to the design mock-ups, upon further development I decided to make the navigation menu vertical for mobile so that the buttons wouldn't be squished together or too small to see. I think this was a better choice, as it could stay horizontal for desktop but then spread out vertically for mobiles and tablets, making the buttons more accessibly clickable.
